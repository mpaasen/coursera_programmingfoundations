      <p>
          Hi I'm Melissa and (as most people) I enjoy music â€” <i>all</i> kinds
          of music.<br />
          Music has always been a big part of my life.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        I started with music lessons when I was 8 and started playing the flute
        when I was 10. Plus I also play the guitar.<br />
        To be fair, <b>I am <u>not</u> a skilled musician</b>, but it's the fun that counts.
